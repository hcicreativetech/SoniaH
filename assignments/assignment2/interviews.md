Transformative Leadership & Creativity in Research:
Formative Need Finding Study with Recent Professors Setting Up Their Lab Groups

## Objectives
Formulate a better understanding of how new professors (years 1 - 3) contend with and apply their experience of creativity in research in forming their own research groups.

Explore perspectives (including iteration within) process, learning and collaboration in newly formed lab groups through concrete examples.

Learn how new professors measure productivity in the early stages of getting their labs off the ground.

Learn what mechanisms they rely on to drive outcomes.

## Questions

### Background

To what extent was creativity a part of your research process and encouraged when you were a student / postdoc?

What were some of the leadership styles that you encountered as a student / postdoc and how have they impacted the vision you have for your group?

At what point did you decide you wanted to be a professor? To what degree did the idea of leading a lab group play a role, if any, in that decision?

### Creativity in research

How do you define creativity in research?

Have you considered the role that creativity might play in your research and how to foster creativity in your lab group?

Are there aspects of your work that feel more creative than others and are these more or less laborious than other tasks?

### Contextualized transformative leadership

To what extent does creativity play a role in your leadership?

In what ways did creativity play a role in how you managed project ____?

How present is creativity in your leadership style? What are the hallmarks of effective leadership in a research lab?

### Processes / Systems / Tools

What mechanisms have you found that have led to effective collaboration in your group between students or between yourself and a student? (Speak about a specific project)

Did you have a predefined set of processes (such as group meetings) in mind when forming your group? How have those evolved & what has motivated their evolution?

In what manner, do you generate approaches to solving a problem?

What organizational tools or systems do you leverage to manage the work in your lab?

How are new projects initiated in your group? Is there a model you have in mind for structuring new research projects?

What day-to-day is essential for your lab group to achieve the research goals that you have in mind?

### Learning

What are the target outcomes for the development of your students over the course of their work with you?

How do you encourage students to learn about a specific area or problem where they lack expertise?

Have you encouraged your students to adopt any particular organizational tools or processes to accelerate or support their research?

### Collaboration

In what way do you encourage students to address or broaden their approach or understanding of a problem? To what degree do the students' approaches and your own align in solving research problems and how does the professor / student dynamic affect the degree to which the collaboration favors one approach or another?

Have you considered the way in which you might facilitate a diversity of perspectives (epistemological pluralism) and how do you negotiate applying constraints that shape the work that needs to be done?

What roles does collaboration (internal and external) play in reaching your ideal lab group and how significant is it? What are the challenges youâ€™ve faced in facilitating collaboration?

What are the challenges you've faced in facilitating collaboration?


### Reflection / Self-evaluation

What are the criteria or benchmarks you are using to evaluate the efficacy of your lab in the early stages of setting up your group?

What are the biggest obstacles to maximizing the productive output (or success as you define it) in your lab?

What are the most challenging elements of leading a newly formed lab group?

What are the biggest risks in leading a new lab group? How have you thought about and mitigated those risks?

Is there anything else you'd like to share about the challenges you've encountered or what have been the most rewarding in setting up a new lab group?
