## *The Promise of Empathy: Design, Disability, and Knowing the “Other”*
by Cynthia L. Bennet and Daniela K. Rosner

Commitments from "Being like" to "Being with"

1. Rather than seek to represent another’s experience, we seek partnerships in imagining the design encounter

2. Rather than achieve an understanding, we seek a process of ongoing attunement

3. Rather than attempt symmetry, we recognize and work with asymmetry.


## *Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete*
by Sherry Turkle and Seymour Papert


Both readings center on the challenges of understanding (or empathizing) with the experience of others.
They communicate fundamental limitations in the ways in which designers can effectively empathize with
those outside their own experience. How do these challenges align with your own experiences in creative
production or collaboration? Are there scenarios in which you have felt unable to understand the
experience of a person you were designing for or working with? Alternatively, how have your own
experiences biased you towards valuing some forms of knowing or production over others?

In collaboration, working with (adapting working styles -- negotiation for any team project)
DSL for dance -- working to understand a dancer's perspective (trying out the movements -- quite frankly felt stupid) had to gain insight into the process. Approach collaboration with gratitude

Need finding cannot only come first. Foreground in iteration -- attunement = convergence

Acknowledging asymmetry (blind, even well-meaning idealism), don't emphasize difference but acknowledge it

relate to something formally
