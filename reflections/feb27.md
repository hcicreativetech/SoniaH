## *LilyPad in the Wild: How Hardware's Long Tail is Supporting New Engineering and Design Communities*
by Leah Buechley and Benjamin Mako Hill

Type 1: Demonstration

Type 2: Usage

Type 3: Technical Performance

Type 4: Heuristics

In-the-wild evaluation combines several aspects of the four strategies discussed in Ledo et al. "Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research." Finding concrete examples of projects provides illustrations of demonstration and usage. Heuristics emerge and technical performance is elucidated in concretizing the design space enabled by the underlying technology and its adoption as made visible from documenting or observing its use in-the-wild. At the same time, in-the-wild evaluation poses several challenges. Firstly, there is an extensive component to gather data regarding the project which may not be viable depending on the prevalence or adoption of the artifact being studied. Even the widely popular LilyPad, yielded publicly documented fewer unique projects that I would have expected. Secondly, this method requires deploying the work. Not only does it have to be cost effective to create a consumer kit but also the technology and usage has to fit into the current time. For instance, there was a significant lag to bring products to market that emulated the functions found in the compelling Mother of All Demos by Sutherland et al. Other projects, such as Buechley's computational ceramics even involve access to equipment that may not yet be readily accessible for target audiences. Lastly, a lot of HCI interfaces and tools are conducted to fill a specific niche and can be evaluated in context. That is, they aim to meet a need as a result of the user focused design process that motivates the work. In-the-wild evaluation is more open-ended and there is a less clear correspondence (note this echoes several problems surrounding using usage as a metric to gauge work in this space).

I had the opportunity to meet with Prof. Buechley last week, and she shared a valuable insight with me. While our conversation focused on co-production and broadening participation and access to the arts and computational thinking, she shared that the focus on user-centered design and need-finding sometimes occludes the possibility for other work that is more simply investigated in making something innovative and interesting that provides an alternative avenue for exploration around creative production. To some extent, the LilyPad Arduino fits this categorization. I am interested in modifying my own approach to focus on products that might be immediately applicable and that have more of this open-ended quality. There seem to be more parallels to learning by making in this approach. I also think that it might be worth reflecting on which outcomes and style of approach have greater impact.
