## *The Textility of Making*

Ceramics:

In working with clay, I'm struck by the fact that common methods in a sense add their own affordances beyond the innate properties of the material itself. To elaborate, if I'm working with slabs or extruded forms or on the wheel, the forms lend themselves to specific styles of manipulation that would be difficult to achieve through a different approach. Therefore, I think where other materials might have more strict affordances I think the rules or styles of manipulation are essential in contributing to situational affordances of any given creative practice. Other affordances of clay can also be seen as limitations due to its physicality. I'm looking forward to exploring 3D printed ceramics soon to see how that affects and deepens my interaction with the medium. With respect to textility, I find I seldom arrive at or rely on a target. Even if I have an idea in mind (an L-shaped birdhouse) and the final product resembles an initial sketch or relies on specific measurements, almost always there is an iterative process and forms emerge from quality and state of the material as well as my improvised interactions with it.

Charcoal:

Charcoal drawings can achieve great depth but require working quite differently -- you have to rely on layering, blending, and often removing the material. Also, I think you have to see differently in terms of light and shadows and form primarily as opposed to looking ad edges or specific textures. In terms of the affordances of charcoal one immediately thinks of working in black and white. While charcoal is similar to pastels I find that I prefer working in charcoal perhaps because it allows me to emphasize and merge depth, light, and color. In considering textility, especially with charcoal, the paper becomes important as a medium. It's thickness and coarseness affects the way the material adheres to the drawing and also impacts blending. So I think my drawings do emerge from the combination of an initial idea and how the paper and charcoal interact together as I build up the drawing layer by layer.
