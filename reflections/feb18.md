## *Environments for Creativity: A Lab for Making Things*
by Ellen Yi-Luen and Mark D. Gross

> We see creativity not as an innate ability, but as a capacity
that can be cultivated through experience making things, 27.

Computing studio labs --> exploration through making Things

Materials and Processes

> Knowledge
of materials and processes — obtained through direct
experience — is fundamental to the ability to make things in
any domain, 28.

Spaces

>  We have never explicitly described our research
practice as a curiosity-based designer-as-maker approach, but
we engage problem solving and problem seeking to
encourage people to see no boundaries between fields. We
encourage exploration by constructing (interface,
interactions, software, and hardware) as a process that
creates, in Seymour Papert’s phrase, “objects to think with”
[32], 28.

> encourage the process of generating ideas and building
prototypes through incremental refinement, 28.

Leonardo Model

> We encourage individuals to transgress traditional
disciplinary boundaries and learn to function in whatever
fields of knowledge they need to accomplish their goals, 28.

> Everyone cannot know everything; tradeoffs must be
made. Yet there is value in learning how “other”
disciplines work, not just from the perspective of how to
collaborate with others, but to understand and see
designing from within more than one domain, 29.

Hill Climbing vs. Hill finding

Understanding niche that tool fills to be able to evaluate it with hypothesis first model driven by pre-determined metrics for evaluation. Instead, product influence and impact emerges as do methods of evaluation as the design evolves.

Owning the Problem --> Designing for your own wants (does this undermine or present an alternative to possibilities introduced by empathy and user centered design / co-production etc?)

Tinkering, Design, Play Instinct --> Encouraging this modality of working with exploration (Bottom up?)

> Play – an exploration of materials and
processes — is what distinguishes routine acts of making,
that is to say production, from more creative acts of making
that may result in innovative ideas, 31.

> creative
work, particularly design work, seldom begins with a clearly
stated problem... design is as much concerned with identifying and
expressing a problem as it is finding solutions, 31.

Building Tools to Make Things --> Less focused on artifacts, more about "developing ways of working
— methods and tools— that can open up new design spaces" (How are these novel design spaces validated?)


Educating designers vs. engineers --> Integrators & supporting open-ended exploration (Maybe engineers should be trained / their education should be challenged to allow them to also learn in open-ended contexts?)

Designing & Programming --> focus on programming (making) not computer science

Emphasizing Prototypes --> Tools to rapidly build high-fidelity or working prototypes

The New Makers --> Designers must be able to make things in any domain (including using computation) (Why not train all people to be designers?)

> One might expect schools
of engineering to teach students to make things, but
engineering curricula are strong on teaching analysis and
principles and light on the actual practice of making, 34.

## *Becoming Facilitators of Creative Computing in Out of School Contexts*
by Ricarose Roque and Rupal Jain


>  Rather than being someone who had the expertise, Maria
realized that what was important was her ability to model how to learn through tinkering and exploration as well
as through pulling on different people in the room, 596.

> His uses of the words “over” and
“under” highlight the continual balancing act of facilitators. As he continued to help them, he struggled with
that balance. Through critical reflection on his experience as well as with other facilitators, he later came to
understand an important question for him to assess if he was over-facilitating: whose ideas are being
represented? To him, over-facilitation occurred when his ideas were incorporated rather than their ideas, 597.

> For Alex, relationship building was an instrumental part of his development as a facilitator as it helped him
know how to intervene and interact with families. In his past experiences helping with technology-based camps,
Alex shared how their top priority was making sure kids were continually “doing stuff and being engaged.”
However, in these workshops, facilitators were encouraged to build relationships with families, 598.

>  There was not one role that
defined a facilitator, but instead multiple entry points and pathways that built on facilitators’ backgrounds and
interests. Their experience was a process of becoming — shifting roles, perspectives, and practices within the
shared activity of facilitating creative computing experiences (Lave & Wenger, 1992; Rogoff, 1994), 598.

Both readings present the idea of "not knowing", or removing the notion of "expert" as a key component to facilitating creativity. From your perspective, what are the benefits of putting aside the ideas of "expert" and "novice" in a creative setting? What are the challenges?

One of the most striking elements for me regarding *Becoming Facilitators* was the shared commonality despite the diverse backgrounds that each of the three facilitators highlighted in the work experienced; namely, they used their expertise based on deep involvement in a particular field from education to technology and at the same time grew in their capacity to facilitate by moving away from patterns that they predominantly relied on in those fields. Perhaps as discussed in *Environments for Creativity* it is important to bring knowledge to the table for everyone to benefit and grow from rather emphasizing expertise in a particular discipline. I thought Roque and Jain accomplished this well in their experimental design of having the facilitators convene at the end of workshops to discuss their experience and support one another. Instead of undermining the value of the diversity of peoples experiences and therefore reducing the benefit of various expertise, this structure augmented the experience of everyone participating. Another challenge touched on in *Environments for Creativity* is that creative making to some degree requires hill-finding, ownership (not designing for the other but internalizing the motivation for the design), and tinkering (exploration through play and making). While everyone benefits from some degree of exploration, given realistic constraints on time it's impossible for one person to understand the whole picture or develop the same level of proficiency in multiple domains. I think that's why effective collaboration and teamwork needs to address how to combine "experts" and "novices" by valuing each person's contributions and strengths and augmenting learning for everyone involved. The key challenges that I see in that context (also I think it's worth mentioning that both papers contextualized their conclusions in specific contexts that may not apply to all disciplines, and that I took issue with the distinction between designers and engineers) are effective communication to bridge gaps between "novices" and "experts", making knowledge first, prioritizing and leaving space for exploration, and convergence of understanding regarding what's being built and the needs that are being addressed.
